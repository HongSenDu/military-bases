# Military Bases Map

### USAGE

Click on each point to zoom in on the base, and click the top left button to reset the map view. There are also additional map controls on the top right of the map.


### Credits/Sources

I used [David Vine's military bases spreadsheet](https://dra.american.edu/islandora/object/auislandora%3A70442) to find the coordinates, titles, descriptions, and sources for each map point.

This interactive map inspired by [Johnny Harris' video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YR2TxHkb4c)
